                    <p>
                        First, Edward was a vampire.

                    <p>
                        Second, there was a part of him - and I didn't know how dominant that part might be - that
                        thirsted for my blood.

                    <p>

                        mesmerizing voice, and supernatural gifts, Edythe is both irresistible and enigmatic.

                        I felt like I was trapped in one of those terrifying nightmares, the one where you have to
                        run, run till your lungs burst, but you can't make your body move fast enough.... But this
                        was no dream, and, unlike the nightmare, I wasn't running for my life; I was racing to save
                        something infinitely more precious. My own life meant little to me today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Bella Swan there is one thing more important than life itself: Edward Cullen. But being
                        in love with a vampire is even more dangerous than Bella could ever have imagined. Edward
                        has already rescued Bella from the clutches of one evil vampire, but now, as their daring
                        relationship threatens all that is near and dear to them, they realize their troubles may be
                        just beginning....

                        Bree Tanner can barely remember her life before she had uncannily powerful senses,
                        superhuman
                        reflexes, and unstoppable physical strength. Life before she had a relentless thirst for
                        blood... life before she became a vampire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All Bree knows is that living with her fellow newborns has few certainties and even fewer
                        rules: watch your back, don't draw attention to yourself, and above all, make it home by
                        sunrise or die. What she doesn't know: her time as an immortal is quickly running out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then Bree finds an unexpected friend in Diego, a newborn just as curious as Bree about their
                        mysterious creator, whom they only know as her. As they come to realize that the newborns
                        are pawns in a game larger than anything they could have imagined, Bree and Diego must
                        choose sides and decide whom to trust. But when everything you know about vampires is based
                        on a lie, how do you find the truth?

                        When you loved the one who was killing you , it left you no options.How could you run, how could
                        you fight, when doing so would hurt that beloved one? If your life was all you had to give, how
                        could you not give it? If it was someone you truly loved?

                    <p>
                        To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a
                        dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion
                        for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, a
                        tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife have led her to the ultimate turning point. Her
                        imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue a fully
                        human life has become the thread from which the fates of two tribes
                        hangs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that Bella has made her decision, a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to
                        unfold with potentially devastating, and unfathomable, consequences. Just when the frayed
                        strands of Bella's life - first discovered in Twilight, then scattered and torn in New Moon
                        and Eclipse - seem ready to heal and knit together, could they be destroyed... forever?

                        This unforgettable tale as told through Edward’s eyes takes on a new and decidedly dark twist.
                        Meeting beautiful, mysterious Bella is both the most intriguing and unnerving event he has
                        experienced in his long life as a vampire. As we learn more fascinating details about Edward’s
                        past and the complexity of his inner thoughts, we understand why this is the defining struggle
                        of his life. How can he let himself fall in love with Bella when he knows that he is endangering
                        her life?

                        <p>About three things I was absolutely positive.</p>
                        <p>First, Edward was a vampire.</p>
                        <p>Second, there was a part of him - and I didn't know how dominant that part might be - that
                            thirsted for my blood.</p>
                        <p>And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.</p>

                            in love with a vampire is even more dangerous than Bella could ever have imagined. Edward
                            has already rescued Bella from the clutches of one evil vampire, but now, as their daring
                            relationship threatens all that is near and dear to them, they realize their troubles may be

                            As Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues
                            her quest for revenge, Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger. In the midst of
                            it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob -
                            knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the ageless struggle between vampire
                            and werewolf. With her graduation quickly approaching, Bella has one more decision to make:
                            life or death. But which is which?

                            BREE TANNER CAN BARELY REMEMBER LIFE before she had uncannily powerful senses, superhuman
                            reflexes, and unstoppable physical strength. Life before she had a relentless thirst for
                            blood... life before she became a vampire.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ALL BREE KNOWS IS THAT LIVING WITH HER fellow newborns has few certainties and even fewer
                            rules: watch your back, don't draw attention to yourself, and above all, make it home by
                            sunrise or die. What she doesn't know: her time as an immortal is quickly running out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            THEN BREE FINDS AN UNEXPECTED FRIEND in Diego, a newborn just as curious as Bree about their
                            mysterious creator, whom they only know as her. As they come to realize that the newborns
                            are pawns in a game larger than anything they could have imagined, Bree and Diego must
                            choose sides and decide whom to trust. But when everything you know about vampires is based
                            on a lie, how do you find the truth?
